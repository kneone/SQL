                        The dog or domestic dog (Canis familiaris or Canis lupus familiaris) is a domesticated descendant of the wolf which is characterized by an upturning tail. The dog is derived from an ancient, extinct wolf, and the modern wolf is the dog's nearest living relative.The dog was the first species to be domesticated, by hunter-gatherers over 15,000 years ago, before the development of agriculture.

                                A Fluffy Corgi is everything but an ordinary dog for many reasons. First of all, we can all agree that Corgis, in general, are adorable and loyal, which makes them great family dogs. They’re playful and love to spend time outside, which is perfect for people who enjoy long walks or spending time at the park. However, not many people know that in the past, their primary purpose was to herd sheep and cattle, which is why they’re easily adaptable to new environments and situations. Because of their history, Corgis can easily adapt to farm life, and they might become a great helper as well.

                                Siberian Huskies originated in Northeast Asia where they are bred by the Chukchi people of Siberia for sled pulling, and companionship. It is an active, energetic, resilient breed, whose ancestors lived in the extremely cold and harsh environment of the Siberian Arctic. William Goosak, a Russian fur trader, introduced them to Nome, Alaska, during the Nome Gold Rush, initially as sled dogs to work the mining fields and for expeditions through otherwise impassable terrain.

                                The Bernese Mountain Dog (German: Berner Sennenhund) is a large dog breed, one of the four breeds of Sennenhund-type dogs from the Swiss Alps. These dogs have roots in the Roman mastiffs. The name Sennenhund is derived from the German Senne ("alpine pasture") and Hund (hound/dog), as they accompanied the alpine herders and dairymen called Senn. Berner (or Bernese in English) refers to the area of the breed's origin, in the canton of Bern. This breed was originally kept as a general farm dog. Large Sennenhunde in the past were also used as draft animals, pulling carts. The breed was officially established in 1912.

                    With the first wave of NFL free agency and a few league-shaking quarterback trades past us, team needs are becoming more clear ahead of the 2022 NFL draft. We've seen which teams have been aggressive in adding veterans and which have sat out free agency (and saved salary-cap space) while looking to a draft class deep with wide receivers and edge rushers. Let's get into a new post-free-agency first-round mock draft. I did my previous mock right before the combine earlier this month, so this one has some notable changes, with the Seahawks (No. 9) entering the first round and the Texans (No. 13) and Packers (No. 22) adding a second Round 1 selection. Where will the first quarterback go? Could the Lions shake things up at No. 2? And what's the Falcons' plan now? As a reminder, I'm going to project the top 32 picks based on a combination of my rankings, team needs and what I'm hearing from execs, scouts and coaches in the league. Round 1 begins April 28, which means there's plenty of time for more changes to come.
